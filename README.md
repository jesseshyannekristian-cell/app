# FOUNDATION — SCP Site Overseer (Terminal Edition)

A standalone, text-based **SCP Foundation management game** played entirely in your terminal.
You are the Overseer of **Site-20**: research and requisition anomalous-containment equipment,
dispatch containment teams, survive live breaches, manage staff dossiers, and file your own
custom SCPs — all driven by a two-currency economy and a rank-progression ladder.

> This is a pure-Python CLI app. No game engine, no 3D assets, no art pipeline required.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- `rich` (already available in this environment): `pip install rich`

## Run it
From the project root (`/app`):

```bash
python -m game.main
# or
python play.py
```

Your progress (save_data.json) and authored SCPs (archives.json) are written to `/app/saves/`.

## Controls
The game is menu-driven. Type the number/letter shown in brackets and press **ENTER**.
In list screens, type the row number to select, or **b** to go back.

## Features (Site Overseer Hub)
- **Research Division** — spend **Research Credits** to complete projects. Each unlocks a
  level-locked store item or a **containment procedure** (which gates certain operations).
- **Requisition Store** — buy equipment with **Credits** (Scranton Reality Anchor, Micro-H.I.D.,
  Epsilon-11 Rifle, Kevlar, Hazmat, Thermal Optics, Femur-Bone Lure, research lab kits…).
  Locked items show `RESEARCH REQ'D` / `RANK LOCK` until requirements are met.
- **Containment Operations** — dispatch teams to contain all 22 SCPs and neutralise 8 rogue
  MTF / GOI threats. Success is an RNG roll (`90 − difficulty·8 + rankAbove·10`, clamped 25–95);
  failure still grants partial field XP.
- **Pre-Breach Loadout** — equip up to 4 owned items; each boosts breach survival odds.
- **Breach Response** — text-based survival event vs. a chosen anomaly (Site-20 roster + your
  breachable custom SCPs). Loadout + rank improve your survival chance; outcome is logged.
- **Site-20 Personnel** — lore dossiers for **GUNZ** (O5 Council / "The Technician"),
  **CHEMOSIC** (Site Supervisor, ex-MTF XI-87 Commander), and the **Head Researcher**.
- **Ranks & Rewards** — 6-rank ladder (Junior Researcher → O5 Overseer OMEGA BLACK) with
  auto-promotion + bonus currency, plus the live-breach record.
- **Archives** — JSON-backed CRUD: create, view, edit, and delete your own custom SCP reports.
  Mark a custom SCP as **breachable** to make it selectable in the Breach menu.
